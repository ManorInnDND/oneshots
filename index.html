				The evil wizard Keraptis has captured you and fitted you with a collar that will supposedly kill you in one 
				day unless you manage to slay his rival, Belamor. Keraptis has a portal into Belamor's lair, once Belamor is 
				destroyed your collar will fall off and you will be free once more.

			<h3>Desert Dummies</h3>
			<p><strong>BK, Brendan, Charlie</strong></p>

			<p class="Core">
				Anilmis of House Qacha (Brendan), Mutthow the Slaughter (BK), and Khleo of Lost Chants (Charlie) are a band of companions in the unsavory city of Revlor,
				located near the Anauroch Desert. The comapnions are a ranger with a 'critter' lizard companion, a stoner druid, and a ambitious and bitter servant 
				of the mighty wizard Telvar. They meet with Drew, a ratling druid who told them where to find some water in need of cleansing before returning to 
				his rat wife and disturbing Khleo. These companions cleansed a water source in the undercity and convinced Anilmis's druid leader, the beautiful
				dryad Orion, to magic some of the water up to a spot on the surface where the water will be spread to the townsfolk for good (really for profit by the 
				companions). Khleo made such a show of concern for the townsfolk that he is now known as 'full-heart' by the druid circle. Back on the surface the companions
				went to a shop owned by Mulkat, Telvar's star pupil-turned-competitor, and bullied a kobold into  betraying his clone/brother kobold's keystone that will 
				activate a portal in a nearby shack and grant access to Murkat's ziggaraut. The party hopes to either recover Telvar's stolen 'Compendium of Cruel Castings' from
				Murkat or demand Murkat teach Khleo sorcery. They steal a keystone from Kobold 7, and then while scuffling with Kobold 2 outsite the shack they witness him explode 
				as his skeleton elongates into an ogre-sized frame and tears critter to bits. They kill the skeleton, go into the shack, and prepare to enter the fireplace/portal.
